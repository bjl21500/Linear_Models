### Examples

Look at AirBnB data

``` r
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location / 2) %>% 
  rename(boro = neighbourhood_group,
         neighborhood = neighbourhood) %>% 
  filter(boro != "Staten Island") %>% 
  select(price, stars, boro, neighborhood, room_type)
```
