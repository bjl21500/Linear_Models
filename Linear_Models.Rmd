```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)

set.seed(1)
```


### Examples

Look at AirBnB data

```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location / 2) %>% 
  rename(boro = neighbourhood_group,
         neighborhood = neighbourhood) %>% 
  filter(boro != "Staten Island") %>% 
  select(price, stars, boro, neighborhood, room_type)
```

Fit a linear model for price as an outcome.

```{r}
fit = lm(price ~ stars + boro, data = nyc_airbnb)

# Price is my outcome
# stars and boro is my 2 predictors  (One main effect for stars, one main effect for boro)
```

Look at some summaries.

```{r}
summary(fit)
summary(fit)$coef
coef(fit)
fitted.values(fit)
```

Look at better summaries.
```{r}
broom::tidy(fit)
# Spits this in a manner that is a dataframe.
# Can do some data manipulation if I want.


fit %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  mutate(term = str_replace(term, "^boro", "Boro: ")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```
